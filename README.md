# Counter-Strike Condition Zero Weapons Project
> Custom weapons project for Sven Co-op

The original 1.6 project is made by following super dedicated team members: D.N.I.O. 071, R4to0, and KernCore

This is the modified version with the weapons from the Counter Strike Condition Zero, Ported by Garompa, Mementocity, and me (SV BOY). This is basicly just the kerncore's cs 1.6's plugin with different assets and some minor changes.
